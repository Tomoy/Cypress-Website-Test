# Cypress-Website-Test
First automated test of a website using Cypress.io

## Steps to run the project

- Install NPM

NPM is a package manager for Javascript, normally if you have node.js installed, it is there. 

More info and steps to install it:

https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm

- Clone the project and open it in your favourite editor.
- Install dependencies of the project:

     `$ npm install`

- Run the tests:

  `$ npm run cypress:open`

This will open Cypress App and show the available Integration Tests, there is only one for now "website.spec.js"

Click on that file name and it will run the test in the selected browser (To be sure is working properly, please select **Chrome brwoser** on the top right of the Cypress app window)
